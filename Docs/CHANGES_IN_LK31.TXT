VERSION 3.1 MANUAL ADDENDUM
===========================

CUSTOM MENU
-----------
Calling menu, on first page a new button is replacing the old TrueWind button.
This is the Custom Menu button. Click on it, and you can find up to 10 menu buttons, plus the Cancel.
By default, some of these buttons are already preassigned. For example, TrueWind Calc, Lock Screen etc.
To configure the Custom Menu, enter System Setup and go to page 10, Interface.
There is a new button for Configure Custom Menu.
Each item can be assigned a custom key, or be Disabled.

The Custom Menu is itself available also as a custom key!
This means that you can assign Custom Menu recall from a custom key, like for example top right.
When you click top right, you would recall the custom menu.


SCREEN ROTATION IN LK8000
-------------------------
LK8000 3.2 detects automatically if the screen has been rotated or changed in resolution, and it will
reconfigure itself for the new state.  It will only adapt for supported resolutions, of course.
This is totally automatic, and nothing has to be configured. For example, on an HX4700 PPC you can use an hardware key to force screen rotation from portrait to landscape and vice-versa. 
LK will immediately adapt to the new orientation.

A menu has been added to force screen resize or rotation, in order to let LK adapt.
Click on Menu, Config 1/3. A new button is called SCREEN MODES.
Screen Modes menu is different for PC and PDA/PNA versions, because functionalities can be different for them.

Screen Modes for PC
Allows you to change to some resolution as 480x272, 640x480 etc., and to Turn Screen (landscape/portrait) using the current resolution.
For example you can change to 320x240, like on a small PNA, and then Turn Screen to get into 240x320 portait mode.

Screen modes for PNA and PPC
On PNA and PPC devices, you have only two buttons for Screen Modes:
Turn 90 degrees
Turn 180 degrees
Do you want to invert upside/down the screen? Use Turn 180. And do it again to go back to previous state.
To rotate by 270 degrees you can either turn 90 for 3 times, or turn 180 and the turn 90.

Notice:
1. On exit LK will NOT turn screen automatically, nor does it on startup. 
   Screen rotation is totally manual operation.
2. Screen rotation must be supported by the PNA/PPC hardware and operating system.
   Some devices cannot rotate the screen. Some other can do it only by adding unsupported unofficial
   rotating drivers by third parties.
   LK is simply asking to the operating system to rotate the screen. If nothing happens, there is nothing
   we can do about it. We dont support hardware patches, nor external rotating drivers.

3. Although it is possible to rotate the screen also while moving/flying, it is NOT wise to do so.
   During screen rotation the software will stop internally for a couple of seconds.

4. Custom fonts are always shared among all screen resolutions/orientations, be careful.
   There is only 1 custom fonts configuration, and this will be used (if used) for all orientations.
   Expecially on PC this can be confusing, because if you have configured a custom font perfect for 
   800x480 and then you change to 320x240 you can imagine the result: fonts are not rescaled!

Screen Rotation is still experimental. 


ENHANCED PROFILE SETUP
----------------------
From Menu, Config 2/3, LK8000 Setup  you enter a new menu, with 6 buttons:

. System Setup, System Save
. Aircraft Setup, Aircraft Save
. Pilot Setup, Pilot Save

Aircraft and Pilot configurations have been exported from the old configuration setup 
and they are now independent items.

    This was happening everytime we were changing overlay colors with a button "Invert Text" and then exit LK.
