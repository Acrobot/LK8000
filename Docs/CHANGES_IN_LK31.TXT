FIXES

    Fix bug (workaround only) quick waypoint selection dialog not disabling underlying mapwindow events.
    It was possible to still call menu, and run another instance of wayquick. On exit, crash.

    Fix bug Waypoint text style in config 11 sometimes changed wrong inside default system configuration.
    This was happening everytime we were changing overlay colors with a button "Invert Text" and then exit LK.

    Fix bug not showing Efficiency configuration is Config menu 6 on Portrait resolutions
