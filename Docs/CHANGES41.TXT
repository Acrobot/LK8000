CHANGES

Default zoom level for multimap MM1 in paragliding mode changed to 20km.

NavFunctions: Use precise formula in FindLatitudeLongitude()

Target dialog for AAT sector fixed
Before the change a Target dialog for narrow AAT sector (like 90o - 180o) was
centered at the center of the circle used to draw the sector and zoomed
to view 2x its radius. Because of that sector was really hard to manage in
AAT tasks. Now the same sector is centered on the screen and stretched on full
screen.

Skip Alternate 1, Alternate 2 and Last Thermal in multitarget rotate if is not defined.




FIXES

Fix wrong lines drawing in task and topology at high zoom levels, due to overflow in distance calculations
