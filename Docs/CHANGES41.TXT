All task option is saved with task ( rule, time gate, aat target .... )

. Added information about landable waypoint on Task Edit screen

. Draw thin green dash line from Current position to Active TurnPoint center

  Only for paragliders, and only when Optimized Route is enabled

. Support for PnaDump tool (also in 4.0b)

.  FLARM version in status, and managed flarm device disconnection.
   Specify baro altitude from flarm if available.

. Multimap 2 empowered: better printed values on screen as boxed overlays, and final glide MC overlay.

. New customkey Reset View . It will instantly bring screen to moving map , and reset all infopages to the first.

. AAT task : Use AAT optimized turn point for overlay data

. NMEA logger creating separated logs for each port, plus a common mixed log.

. Unselect sideview zoom after MM change in Flarm Radar (same as other multimaps).
  300m default zoom for sideview

.     Fix text keyboard not resetting content on startup. We show old content, before deleting it upon any key activity, except DEL.
    With DEL , we only cancel last character keeping the old content.

. Add airspace type in dialogs, colored accordingly , to be intuitive.





CHANGES

Default zoom level for multimap MM1 in paragliding mode changed to 20km.

NavFunctions: Use precise formula in FindLatitudeLongitude()

Target dialog for AAT sector fixed
Before the change a Target dialog for narrow AAT sector (like 90o - 180o) was
centered at the center of the circle used to draw the sector and zoomed
to view 2x its radius. Because of that sector was really hard to manage in
AAT tasks. Now the same sector is centered on the screen and stretched on full
screen.

Skip Alternate 1, Alternate 2 and Last Thermal in multitarget rotate if is not defined.




FIXES

Fix wrong lines drawing in task and topology at high zoom levels, due to overflow in distance calculations
