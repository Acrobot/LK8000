NEW 
- Logger fields "Competition Class" and "Competition ID". 
  Class example> Standard    ID Example> AG

- Airspace Class G
- Semi-transparent airspace area configuration. This will also fix problems on HTC D2 .
  Using semitransparent will slow down a bit other devices, but only a bit.

- Transparent bottom bar, configurable inside system config menu 11 "Appearance".
  Using 0% or 100% opacity will make no impact on drawing speed because alphablending will not 
  be used in these two cases, and by default 100% is used. 
  Help:
Defines how much transparent (->0%) / opaque (->100%) will be the bottom bar area on the map .
Normally the bar is black with white text, and can be reverted to white with black text on it.
Setting <30% opacity the bottom bar will be very transparent, and text color will be forced reversed.
Some combinations of opacity and reverse colors may not be suitable to navigation, but there are
infinite combinations to choose from.
Using 0% or 100%  (full transparency  or full opacity) will speed up the software a bit.
Another famous 8000 instrument is using 75% opacity.
Default is 100% (full opacity).

  

CHANGES

- Faster topology painting when huge topo maps were used.
- Waypoint Out of Terrain selection back in configuration page 1
  Use "exclude" if you are loading big continental waypoint file databases

- McCready Overlay choice in Engineering menu 1 is now saved to profile


BUGFIX
- Altitude Required (AltReqD) flipping two different values, one correct and the other wrong

- Topology labels were not correctly printed using special character sets for some languages
  They may result truncated.

- Volkslogger declaration possible problem

- Wrong polar for Ventus 2cT

- Some topology/terrain shapes may not be printed (expecially water areas such as small lakes)

- Choosing Waypoint Out of Terrain as "ask" would not save correctly the choice inside profile

- Lklanguage problem with incompatible language pack may crash the software on startup

- Waypoint distance overlay did not show on the first line, right corner, in half overlay mode
