WHATS NEW IN 2.1d0


NEW

- New Setup Setting for Font Smoothing
  System Page 11 choose from None, Default, Antialiasing and Cleartype.
  On some devices/resolution/orientation sometimes one choice is better than the other.

- New SCREEN LOCKING system for paragliders.
  This feature is available only in Para/Hang Gliding mode.
  A new menu button is available in Config 1/3 page:  LOCK SCREEN.
  This feature is available only while not flying, and thus no takeoff was detected,
  otherwise it is blanked and you cannot click on it.
  Locking the screen will help paragliders not to have LK react to keypresses during the
  takeoff , when the pilot is in a critical phase.
  Screen will report "SCREEN IS LOCKED", and will remain locked until 10 SECONDS AFTER TAKEOFF.
  After 10 seconds from takeoff detected, the screen will be AUTOMATICALLY unlocked.
  If the pilot for any reason wants to unlock the screen, he can double-click on screen any
  time to do it.
  When the screen is locked, no function can be used on the touch screen, but hardware keys 
  are still operational.

- Preliminar OLC work testbench from Mateusz

CHANGES

- AAT permanently ON for paragliders in configuration. 
  With non-AT looking settings, though.

- Outlined thermal circle also for paragliders


BUGFIX

-  Bugfix Home Waypoint on multitarget not updated when unreachable 
   and not the same as a task point, or an alternate itself.

-  Bugfix finish line or sector not appearing when a task had only 2 turnpoints including start.

-  Bugfix Waypoint parser loading unusual CUP files may crash the software while loading configuration

-  Bugfix task restart was advancing to second turnpoint after start, if previously had passed 
   first turnpoint after start!  This problem was here since ever.

-  Bugfix loading airspaces, with faulty files might crash the software

-  Attempt to prevent possible problem with Battery Manager messages.

- (refix LX declaration for non standard ASCII waypoint names)

- (Infobox Title and description string terminations fixed)
  The description _and_ title also displayed if description was too long, 
  because of description null termination missing.

- (Fix bug Target 4.x page with _@M1008 and 1002 values appearing)


VERSION 2.1c  110218
======================================================================================

NEW

- Task declaration for LX Nano, LX Colibri
- Transparent Variometer Bar (options selectable inside variometer bar color config)
- New custom device LK8EX1 for external instruments sending baro and vario to LK

CHANGES

- Heap space memory check  (TO USE!)
- Center area for nearest pages selection is enlarged
- Startup sequence will issue more detailed messages if directories are missing,
  pointing the user to the real problem and solution

BUGFIX
- 2.1b problem with tokens over 999
- 2.1b bug DSX coordinates in task declaration (not a Mat's bug! Specs were wrong).
- 2.1b bug Battery Level warnings would crash the software
- OAT Outside Air Temperature not shown below 1 C degree. Now valid from -50 to 99C



VERSION 2.1b
======================================================================================

NEW 

- Logger fields "Competition Class" and "Competition ID". 
  Class example> Standard    ID Example> AG

- Airspace Class G

- Semi-transparent airspace area configuration. This will also fix problems on HTC D2 .
  Using semitransparent will slow down a bit other devices, but only a bit.

- Transparent bottom bar, configurable inside system config menu 11 "Appearance".
  Using 0% or 100% opacity will make no impact on drawing speed because alphablending will not 
  be used in these two cases, and by default 60% is used. 
  Help:
  Defines how much transparent (->0%) / opaque (->100%) will be the bottom bar area on the map .
  Normally the bar is black with white text, and can be reverted to white with black text on it.
  Setting <30% opacity the bottom bar will be very transparent, and text color will be forced reversed.
  Some combinations of opacity and reverse colors may not be suitable to navigation, but there are
  infinite combinations to choose from.
  Using 0% or 100%  (full transparency  or full opacity) will speed up the software a bit.
  Another famous 8000 instrument is using 75% opacity.
  Default is 60%.

- New device DSX supporting task declaration

- New device Flytec FLYSEN protocol, preliminar support

- New Com message "GPS data error " when using wrong baud rate on a com port


CHANGES

- Faster topology painting when huge topo maps were used.

- Waypoint Out of Terrain selection back in configuration page 1
  Use "exclude" if you are loading big continental waypoint file databases

- McCready Overlay choice in Engineering menu 1 is now saved to profile

- NEW AUTO ZOOM
    
    1. AutoZoom bugs:
    - Changing zoom in Circling Zoom disables AutoZoom
    - Changing zoom in PAN mode disables AutoZoom
    - Enabling AutoZoom in PAN mode disables PAN mode
    - Panorama Zoom not working when AutoZoom is enabled
    - Enabling AutoZoom in Panorama Zoom destroys Panorama Zoom behavior
    - AutoZoom corrupts circling and cruise zoom if waypoint switched during
      circling mode
    
    2. Other bugs:
    - Changing ZOOM in PAN mode changes fly zoom
    - Panorama Zoom corrupts fly zoom if fly mode (circling/cruise) change
     in the meantime
    - Panorama Zoom changes PAN zoom when expired
    - Opening TargetPan during Panorama Zoom destroys Panorama Zoom
    - Pan Mode while Panorama Zoom expiration destroys fly zoom level
    - PANORAMA zoom does not remember its zoom value
    
    New design:
    1. Provides separate zoom levels for each of the following:
    - CRUISE
    - CIRCLING (if CirclingZoom is enabled in SystemSetup)
    - PANORAMA
    - AUTO_ZOOM
    - PAN
    - TARGET_PAN
    2. Zoom is switched together with a switch of flight mode, and a zoom
    for previous mode is always remembered and restored. Exception here is:
    - AUTO_ZOOM - that when switched on will always calculate the best zoom
                  for the next waypoint (CRUISE zoom if a waypoint is far away
                  or calculated zoom if closer)
    - PAN - that when switched on will init with the the zoom factor of
            previous mode (current zoom factor)
    - TARGET_PAN - that when switched on will always calculate the best zoom
                  for the presentation of the waypoint in subject
    3. AutoZoom will be turned off on pilot's manual zoom change action only
    if CRUISE_ZOOM is currently used. That means that a pilot can freely
    adjust the zoom for circling, panorama or pan without worrying about
    disabling and then a need to enable AutoZoom.
    4. Advancing a waypoint to the next one when AutoZoom is enabled will
    always adjust CRUISE_ZOOM only (even if not active at that moment)

. Very fast loading of big waypoint files at startup

. Faster response of user interface when using big waypoint files

. It is now possible to load over 8000 waypoints while still keeping good user interface
  response

. Task declaration messages are more detailed
. Progress and error messages added for EW Microrecorder task declaration

. Automatic com port reset will apply after 30 seconds, previously 15 seconds, when no
  nmea source feed is found.

. BestAlternate is back available also for Paragliders/Hang Gliders. Previously it was not
  calculated any more, and disabled by rotary multitargets.  
  Para/Hang gliders disabling BestAlternate Warning inside safety config will also make it
  disappear from rotary multitarget selection.

BUGFIX

- Altitude Required (AltReqD) flipping two different values, one correct and the other wrong

- Topology labels were not correctly printed using special character sets for some languages
  They may result truncated.

- Volkslogger declaration possible problem

- Wrong polar for Ventus 2cT

- Some topology/terrain shapes may not be printed (expecially water areas such as small lakes)

- Choosing Waypoint Out of Terrain as "ask" would not save correctly the choice inside profile

- Lklanguage problem with incompatible language pack may crash the software on startup

- Waypoint distance overlay did not show on the first line, right corner, in half overlay mode
 
- Airspaces filtering too restrictive fixed
  When an aircraft was inside airspace's boundary and the Anlysis dialog
  airspaces draw line did not cross that boundary (because airspace is
  too big) the airspace was not printed in the Analysis Airspace dialog.

- Various communication problems solved. Sometimes a device after disconnection was no more seen until a 
  port reset.
