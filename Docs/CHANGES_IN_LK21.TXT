NEW 
- Logger fields "Competition Class" and "Competition ID". 
  Class example> Standard    ID Example> AG

- Airspace Class G
- Semi-transparent airspace area configuration. This will also fix problems on HTC D2 .
  Using semitransparent will slow down a bit other devices, but only a bit.

CHANGES

- Faster topology painting when huge topo maps were used.
- Waypoint Out of Terrain selection back in configuration page 1
  Use "exclude" if you are loading big continental waypoint file databases

- McCready Overlay choice in Engineering menu 1 is now saved to profile


BUGFIX
- Altitude Required (AltReqD) flipping two different values, one correct and the other wrong

- Topology labels were not correctly printed using special character sets for some languages
  They may result truncated.

- Volkslogger declaration possible problem

- Wrong polar for Ventus 2cT

- Some topology/terrain shapes may not be printed (expecially water areas such as small lakes)

- Choosing Waypoint Out of Terrain as "ask" would not save correctly the choice inside profile
