WHATS NEW IN 2.1b
updated 110214

VERSION 2.1x
------------

NEW

- Task declaration for LX Nano, LX Colibri
- Transparent Variometer Bar (options selectable inside variometer bar color config)

CHANGES

- Heap space memory check  (TO USE!)
- Center area for nearest pages selection is enlarged

BUGFIX
- 2.1b problem with tokens over 999


VERSION 2.1b
------------

NEW 

- Logger fields "Competition Class" and "Competition ID". 
  Class example> Standard    ID Example> AG

- Airspace Class G

- Semi-transparent airspace area configuration. This will also fix problems on HTC D2 .
  Using semitransparent will slow down a bit other devices, but only a bit.

- Transparent bottom bar, configurable inside system config menu 11 "Appearance".
  Using 0% or 100% opacity will make no impact on drawing speed because alphablending will not 
  be used in these two cases, and by default 60% is used. 
  Help:
  Defines how much transparent (->0%) / opaque (->100%) will be the bottom bar area on the map .
  Normally the bar is black with white text, and can be reverted to white with black text on it.
  Setting <30% opacity the bottom bar will be very transparent, and text color will be forced reversed.
  Some combinations of opacity and reverse colors may not be suitable to navigation, but there are
  infinite combinations to choose from.
  Using 0% or 100%  (full transparency  or full opacity) will speed up the software a bit.
  Another famous 8000 instrument is using 75% opacity.
  Default is 60%.

- New device DSX supporting task declaration

- New device Flytec FLYSEN protocol, preliminar support

- New Com message "GPS data error " when using wrong baud rate on a com port


CHANGES

- Faster topology painting when huge topo maps were used.

- Waypoint Out of Terrain selection back in configuration page 1
  Use "exclude" if you are loading big continental waypoint file databases

- McCready Overlay choice in Engineering menu 1 is now saved to profile

- NEW AUTO ZOOM
    
    1. AutoZoom bugs:
    - Changing zoom in Circling Zoom disables AutoZoom
    - Changing zoom in PAN mode disables AutoZoom
    - Enabling AutoZoom in PAN mode disables PAN mode
    - Panorama Zoom not working when AutoZoom is enabled
    - Enabling AutoZoom in Panorama Zoom destroys Panorama Zoom behavior
    - AutoZoom corrupts circling and cruise zoom if waypoint switched during
      circling mode
    
    2. Other bugs:
    - Changing ZOOM in PAN mode changes fly zoom
    - Panorama Zoom corrupts fly zoom if fly mode (circling/cruise) change
     in the meantime
    - Panorama Zoom changes PAN zoom when expired
    - Opening TargetPan during Panorama Zoom destroys Panorama Zoom
    - Pan Mode while Panorama Zoom expiration destroys fly zoom level
    - PANORAMA zoom does not remember its zoom value
    
    New design:
    1. Provides separate zoom levels for each of the following:
    - CRUISE
    - CIRCLING (if CirclingZoom is enabled in SystemSetup)
    - PANORAMA
    - AUTO_ZOOM
    - PAN
    - TARGET_PAN
    2. Zoom is switched together with a switch of flight mode, and a zoom
    for previous mode is always remembered and restored. Exception here is:
    - AUTO_ZOOM - that when switched on will always calculate the best zoom
                  for the next waypoint (CRUISE zoom if a waypoint is far away
                  or calculated zoom if closer)
    - PAN - that when switched on will init with the the zoom factor of
            previous mode (current zoom factor)
    - TARGET_PAN - that when switched on will always calculate the best zoom
                  for the presentation of the waypoint in subject
    3. AutoZoom will be turned off on pilot's manual zoom change action only
    if CRUISE_ZOOM is currently used. That means that a pilot can freely
    adjust the zoom for circling, panorama or pan without worrying about
    disabling and then a need to enable AutoZoom.
    4. Advancing a waypoint to the next one when AutoZoom is enabled will
    always adjust CRUISE_ZOOM only (even if not active at that moment)

. Very fast loading of big waypoint files at startup

. Faster response of user interface when using big waypoint files

. It is now possible to load over 8000 waypoints while still keeping good user interface
  response

. Task declaration messages are more detailed
. Progress and error messages added for EW Microrecorder task declaration

. Automatic com port reset will apply after 30 seconds, previously 15 seconds, when no
  nmea source feed is found.

. BestAlternate is back available also for Paragliders/Hang Gliders. Previously it was not
  calculated any more, and disabled by rotary multitargets.  
  Para/Hang gliders disabling BestAlternate Warning inside safety config will also make it
  disappear from rotary multitarget selection.

BUGFIX

- Altitude Required (AltReqD) flipping two different values, one correct and the other wrong

- Topology labels were not correctly printed using special character sets for some languages
  They may result truncated.

- Volkslogger declaration possible problem

- Wrong polar for Ventus 2cT

- Some topology/terrain shapes may not be printed (expecially water areas such as small lakes)

- Choosing Waypoint Out of Terrain as "ask" would not save correctly the choice inside profile

- Lklanguage problem with incompatible language pack may crash the software on startup

- Waypoint distance overlay did not show on the first line, right corner, in half overlay mode
 
- Airspaces filtering too restrictive fixed
  When an aircraft was inside airspace's boundary and the Anlysis dialog
  airspaces draw line did not cross that boundary (because airspace is
  too big) the airspace was not printed in the Analysis Airspace dialog.

- Various communication problems solved. Sometimes a device after disconnection was no more seen until a 
  port reset.
