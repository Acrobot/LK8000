LK8000 VERSION 4.0B  

CHANGES
-------

Paraglider's Time gates: last gate is always lasting up to 3 hours. In practice, it never closes.

FIXES
-----

CAI302 bug in wind indication, offset by 180 degrees.

Labels not correctly painted in Flarm Radar


Baro altitude frozen.
This was happening when the same port was shared with different devices using a mechanical switch, or a mix
er.
We now check that the baro altitude is changing if the gps altitude is changing too.
After 1 minute of possible problem, if we are using baro altitude for navigation, we alert the pilot, and we disable the baro altitude usage.
If the baro altitude is back available, the pilot must then re-enable its usage with the button.
After 3 times of this problem appearing, we only disable EnableBaroAltitude and we dont reset the baroaltitude anymore, assuming there is a flip/flop condition and a faulty hardware line. Checks after 3 times are delayed to 3 minutes.

Fix thermal exit detection for paragliders.
Also improve detection of thermal entering, filtering a bit more false initial turning.

Screen flickering on PC greatly reduced when using pan scroll mode.

Possible critical problem drawing multimap airspaces

Fix bug loading CUP waypoints, incorrect removing trailing quotes.
    Bug found by Berthold Bredenbeck after..4 years it was there.
    If the waypoint was
    "fullname",codename,....
    all was correct, name=fullname
    if the line is
    fullname,codename,..   without quotes "", then name=fullnam  without trailing letter "e".


Fix critical bug in EYE device driver


SMALL FIXES
-----------

Trail is drawn OVER airfields, no more under them.

Nearest Waypoint search did not work if we had only markers, and no waypoint files

TRI page not resetted correctly after change of screen resolution.
